# LSTM Stock Prediction Project

## Project Description
This project is a demo to predict stock price in the next 5 days using LSTM model.

## Project Goal
1. Predict the stock price based on 3 days window.
2. The dataset used is the stock price of the S&P 500 companies(msft).
3. The prediction accuracy is 90%.
4. The project can be run on a local machine.

## Project Outline 
1. Data preprocessing
2. Model training
3. Model evaluation
4. Model prediction
5. Model deployment

## Project Details
1. The dataset used is the stock price of the MicroSoft.
2. The model used is LSTM.
3. The prediction accuracy is 86%.
4. The project is implemented using Python and PyTorch.

## File Structure
1. data: data source
2. model: model file
3. main.py: main function

## Accuracy
- This prediction may not as accuracy as real-time stock price since:
    1. Stock price performance is not only a math game, but a game of psychology and economics.
    2. The prediction is based on historical data, which may not reflect the current situation.
    3. The prediction model is not perfect, and it may make mistakes.

## Run
- python main.py
